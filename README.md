NeuroNudge: Cloud Deployed AI Precision Cursor
The proposed AI virtual mouse system can be used to overcome problems in the real world such as situations where there is no space to use a physical mouse and also for the persons who have problems in their hands and are not able to control a physical mouse. So the proposed AI virtual mouse can be used to overcome these problems since hand gesture and hand Tip detection is used to control the PC mouse functions by using a webcam or a built-in camera. The following describes the general problem that the current physical mouse suffers: 
• Special hardware is required for a physical mouse.
• The performance of a physical mouse changes according on the surroundings, and it is difficult to adjust to varied environments. 
• Both wired and wireless mouse have their own life expectancies.
